# OpenManus-RL
ü§ó <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/CharlieDreemur/OpenManus-RL" target="_blank">Dataset (OpenManus-RL)</a>

OpenManus-RL is an open-source initiative collaboratively led by __Ulab-UIUC__ and __MetaGPT__ .

This project is an extended version of the original [@OpenManus](https://github.com/FoundationAgents/OpenManus) initiative. Inspired by successful RL tunning for reasoning LLM such as Deepseek-R1, QwQ-32B, we will explore new paradigms for RL-based LLM agent tuning, particularly building upon foundations.

We are committed to regularly updating our exploration directions and results in a dynamic, live-streaming fashion. All progress, including rigorous testing on agent benchmarks such as GAIA, AgentBench, WebShop, and OSWorld, and tuned models, will be openly shared and continuously updated.

We warmly welcome contributions from the broader community‚Äîjoin us in pushing the boundaries of agent reasoning and tool integration!

Code and dataset are now available! The `verl` submodule has been integrated for enhanced RL training capabilities.

## Method

Our method proposes an advanced reinforcement learning (RL)-based agent tuning framework designed to significantly enhance reasoning and decision-making capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Drawing inspiration from RAGEN's Reasoning-Interaction Chain Optimization (RICO), our approach further explores novel algorithmic structures, diverse reasoning paradigms, sophisticated reward strategies, and extensive benchmark environments.

### Reasoning Models Exploration
To benchmark the reasoning capabilities effectively, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art reasoning models:
- **GPT-O1**
- **Deepseek-R1**
- **QwQ-32B**

Each model provides unique reasoning capabilities that inform downstream optimization and training strategies.

### Alternative Rollout Strategies
We experiment with a variety of rollout strategies to enhance agent planning efficiency and reasoning robustness, including:

- **Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)**: Employs tree-based reasoning paths, enabling agents to explore branching possibilities systematically.
- **Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT)**: Utilizes graph structures to represent complex reasoning dependencies effectively.
- **DFSDT (Depth-First Search Decision Trees)**: Optimizes action selection through depth-first search, enhancing long-horizon planning.
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**: Explores reasoning and decision paths probabilistically, balancing exploration and exploitation effectively.

These methods help identify optimal rollout techniques for various reasoning tasks.

### Diverse Reasoning Formats
We specifically analyze and compare several reasoning output formats, notably:

- **ReAct**: Integrates reasoning and action explicitly, encouraging structured decision-making.
- **Outcome-based Reasoning**: Optimizes toward explicit outcome predictions, driving focused goal alignment.

These formats are rigorously compared to derive the most effective reasoning representation for various tasks.

### Post-Training Strategies
We investigate multiple post-training methodologies to fine-tune agent reasoning effectively:

- **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: Initializes reasoning capabilities using human-annotated instructions.
- **Generalized Reward-based Policy Optimization (GRPO)**: Incorporates:
    - **Format-based Rewards**: Rewards adherence to specified reasoning structures.
    - **Outcome-based Rewards**: Rewards accurate task completion and goal attainment.
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: Enhances agent stability through proximal updates.
- **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**: Leverages explicit human preferences to optimize agent outputs directly.
- **Preference-based Reward Modeling (PRM)**: Uses learned reward functions derived from human preference data.

### Training of Agent Reward Model
We train specialized agent reward models using annotated data to accurately quantify nuanced reward signals. These models are then leveraged to guide agent trajectory selection during both training and evaluation phases.

### Test-time Scaling of Trajectories
During the inference phase, trajectory scaling methods are implemented, allowing agents to flexibly adapt to varying task complexities, thus enhancing robustness and performance in real-world scenarios.

### Action Space Awareness and Strategic Exploration
Agents are equipped with action-space awareness, employing systematic exploration strategies designed to navigate complex action spaces effectively, ultimately maximizing expected rewards.

### Integration with RL Tuning Frameworks
We integrate insights and methodologies from leading RL tuning frameworks, including:

- **Verl** - **Integrated as Git Submodule** - Our primary RL framework, providing advanced training capabilities for agent optimization
- **TinyZero**
- **OpenR1**
- **Trlx**

### Verl Integration
The `verl` submodule is fully integrated into OpenManus-RL, providing:
- **Advanced RL Algorithms** - PPO, DPO, and custom reward modeling
- **Efficient Training** - Optimized for large language model fine-tuning
- **Flexible Configuration** - Easy customization of training parameters
- **Production Ready** - Battle-tested framework from Bytedance

Through these frameworks, agents can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, optimize reasoning processes, and adapt dynamically to novel environments.

In summary, our method systematically integrates advanced reasoning paradigms, diverse rollout strategies, sophisticated reward modeling, and robust RL frameworks, significantly advancing the capability and adaptability of reasoning-enhanced LLM agents.
